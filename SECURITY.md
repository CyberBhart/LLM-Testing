- Be mindful of **prompt injections, data leakage, hallucinations, and model misuse** risks.  
- Always handle test data responsibly and avoid testing on production or live systems without explicit consent.  
- Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies when using or testing LLM systems.
